# LabVIEW Open Benchmark Suite (LOBS)
An open, reproducible benchmarking initiative for LabVIEW GPU and CPU toolkits.

Inspired by SPEC, MLPerf, and Graiphicâ€™s first open benchmark series,  
LOBS aims to establish transparent, standardized test cases for:
- FFT & Signal Processing
- Linear Algebra (GEMM, Conv2D)
- Elementwise Arithmetic
- AI Inference (ONNX models)
- Memory & Transfer Latency

The goal: provide an **independent, reproducible, and vendor-neutral** benchmarking baseline  
for the LabVIEW and ONNX Runtime ecosystem.
